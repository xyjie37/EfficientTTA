## Consistency Optimization
Consistency-optimized Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) algorithms typically maintain source-free online prediction consistency within a joint optimization framework over input perturbation and model parameter spaces. This is achieved by enforcing a self-supervised perturbation invariance constraint on features and predictions, such as the Mean-Teacher model, which utilizes an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for implicit distillation.
